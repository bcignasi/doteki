## Coding guidelines

- Use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to format your code before submitting a pull request.
- Functions should be type annotated. Use `mypy` to check for type errors.
- Keep the code clean and maintainable. Here are some guidelines:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand guidelines</summary>

1. **Test coverage**: Ensure comprehensive code coverage and keep tests readable. 80% coverage is the minimum; 100% is nice to have.

2. **Short, focused functions**: Keep functions brief and adhere to a single responsibility. Minimise arguments and make function signatures intuitive.

3. **Descriptive naming**: Use unambiguous names to clarify function and variable purpose.

4. **Consistent level**: Maintain one level of abstraction or focus within functions.

5. **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself; abstract repeated code into functions.

6. **Error handling**: Use logging and provide clear, actionable error messages.

7. **Minimal comments**: Keep code self-explanatory. Explain the why, not the how.

8. **Early returns**: Avoid deep nesting.
